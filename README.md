Module 32: Learning about the MVC, JSON Serialization, and Spring Web

This repository consists of two branches:
- Module Code
- SpringMVC

Module Code contains code from the module and answers to the module questions.
SpringMVC contains code for the Spring Web introduction, where logging filter is made, sadly the code doesn't work so I will come back to it in later time.
